            Exhausting routine punctuated by moment of terror. This was the life on a British man-of-war during the Napoleonic War. The new Russell Crowe movie, "Master and Commander," gives a glimse into a world where a life centered around a narrow area between two 12-pound guns where you strung your canvas hammock and ate from a table suspended from the crossbeams.</p>
